                <h3>Wildfire</h3>
                <p>Author: Hannah Grace </p>
                <p>This book was a recent summer read. I hace read other books by this author that I loved and wanted to give another book a try! 
                    This book had everything you look for in a basic romcom! With the setting being at a summer camp, it really made me want to be a 
                    summer staff for my camp (which I did end up doing for a week)!

                <h3>Heartless Hunter</h3>
                <p>Author: Kristen Ciccarelli</p>
                <p>A true fantasy with lots of twist and mysteries! Featuring a witch in a world where witches are sent to death. I liked this book, although it did have a 
                    lot of random side stories that were boring to me. I might not pick up the second one in this series.</p>
            </article>
                <h3>Reckless</h3>
                <p>Author: Lauren Roberts</p>
                <p>I love love LOVED this book. As it was the second in this new series, I waited months for this to come out. I preorderd and everything and it did NOT disapoint!
                    The only thing I didnt like was how fast I read it! It definitly nedded 10 more chapters...</p>

                <h3>City of Lies and Legends (House of Devils, #3)</h3>
                <p>Author: Kayla Eduards </p>
                <p>This book was the third and most recent book in the series. Thats means it left me on a MAJOR CLIFF HANGER
                     (Thanks Kayla...Reallyyyy appreciate it). I loved this book thought! I was worried after reading the seciond one that 
                     I would loose interest as the second one seemed very slow. However, this book 
                     picked up speed and introduced more characters that I almost (ALMOST) couldn't keep up 
                     with. BUT, I did and it was awesome. 10/10 - minus 1 for the awful cliffhanger with no idea for book 4's 
                     release date.
