        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>At 20, I find myself with a passion for design and technology, currently pursuing a degree in 
            emerging technology and business in design. My favorite pastime is using my creativity which shines 
            through my love for redecorating my room and hanging out with my friends. Throughout the week you can 
            find me serving at Perkins, A bakery and restaurant along with being at school the other days. In my 
            downtime, I enjoy cozying up with a good book and an iced coffee, all while being accompanied by my beloved 
            Bengal Tiger cat, Tittin. When the weather permits, I trade books for snowboarding, embracing the thrill of the 
            slopes as a perfect complement to my busy life. </p>
